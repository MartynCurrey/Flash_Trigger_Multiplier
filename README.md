# Flash_Trigger_Multiplier
Simple trigger multiplier using 3,5mm sockets


I originally built a 1 in 4 out flash trigger multiplier using a small perf board. Later, I exyended it to 1 in 6 out and created a proper PCB.
The circuit joins all the flashes together and should only be used with flash guns of the same model or when they all have the same trigger voltage.

## Perfboard
Works with 1 to 4 flash guns.
